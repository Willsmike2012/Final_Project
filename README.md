In this capstone project, we will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using several machine learning classification algorithms.
The main steps in this project include: Data collection, wrangling, and formatting; Exploratory data analysis; Interactive data visualization; Machine learning predictionâ€¢ 
Our graphs show that some features of the rocket launches have a correlation with the outcome of the launches, i.e., success or failure.
It is also concluded that decision tree may be the best machine learning algorithm to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.
